%\section{Statement of Contributions}

The goal of this research is to create a secure, scalable,and resilient IoT/CPS architecture by using analytics within the gateway to distribute edge device connection among gateways for resiliency, using machine learning to monitor a secure system state, provide feedback regarding anomalies to the user, and collect relevant data to determine who or what caused the anomaly. To secure the system further, device handshakes between devices will be investigated in an effort to determine a secure and scalable method for devices to connect into collectives. Finally, architectures include mesh, point-to-point, single-tier gateway, and multi-tier 
interconnection (network) architectures will be investigate to determine their benefits and weaknesses(singly and in composition) as a system scales from a few devices to thousands of devices and beyond.
