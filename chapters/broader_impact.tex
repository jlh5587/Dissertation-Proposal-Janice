%\section{Broader Impact}

This dissertation and research aim to provide a scalable architecture for large-scale IoT/CPS applications including smart grids, smart hospitals and smart factories. The use of embedded HPC in a scalable IoT framework will allow for more powerful programming and computing opportunities including machine learning to provide active monitoring on a systems, smart routing to enable more efficient flow of network traffic, and light-weight handshakes for low resource devices. As IoT/CPS application spread from home automation and security, to smart healthcare, and to the smart grid, IoT/CPS system are increasingly integrated into everyday life and therefore it becomes more necessary and import to provide and secure, resilient, and scalable system.

%The use of machine learning for security can be adapted to other forms of computing, particularly with Linux-based machines. With data reported back from each anomaly, this research also provides a forensics ready system which is needed given jurisdiction complications once data is sent to the cloud. 

%
% I'd focus more on the fact that workable IoT systems have many
% application verticals.
