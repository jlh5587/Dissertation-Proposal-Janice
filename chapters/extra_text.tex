The M-TRA would provide the foundation for a coalition of gateways to be formed. The coalition of gateways would allow for decision making to occur over a group of devices and no single device would maintain control over the entire system. An edge device would enter the CPS and send a beacon message to find a gateway. The gateway that receives the beacon would collaborate with the coalition to determine if the new edge device can be trusted. If it is not trusted, they will alert the user and the device will not be allowed to enter the system. If it is trusted, the device will then be allowed in the system. The coalition of gateways will assign a primary gateway for the edge device to communicate with a secondary gateway as backup if the primary gateway goes down. These gateways will be determined based on reducing latency for transmission, balancing the load across the system, and distributing sensors in manner such that if a gateway does malfunction an entire sector of sensors does not disconnect.
